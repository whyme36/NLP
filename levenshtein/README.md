# Levenshtein

In this repository I have a file that calculates the levenshtein matrix along with the distance between two words (levenshtein.py).

This method is visualized using the ```dash``` package (dash_levenshtein.py), making it interactive. 

## Input

Two inputs on the page.

## Method

The distance between two words is the smallest number of simple actions that carry one word to the other.

When counting the distance, a distance matrix is created that represents how far the first word must travel to become the second.

Levenshtein distance and the levenshtein matrix on the page.
