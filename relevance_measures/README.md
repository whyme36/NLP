## Reading


Reading a file:
* number of documents (n),
* n lines with documents,
* relevance of documents.

## Processing

The input only contains the document number + document relevancy in the form of a string. It was necessary to assign a relevance or lack of it to each document number in relation to the relevance given at the end, so that we could later calculate the measures:
* precision
* relative recall
* f_socre
* mean_average_precision 


## Output

Displayed a list of measures for each document.
